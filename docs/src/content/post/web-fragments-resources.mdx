Hey folks! 👋

If you have been curious about Web Fragments and want to learn more about what we are building, you are in the right place. We have been out there talking about micro-frontends, sharing our vision, and geeking out about frontend architecture. And lucky for you, we recorded it all!

Here are some videos that will get you up to speed on Web Fragments and why we think this is a game changer for frontend teams everywhere.

## Web Fragments at Scale

First up, this talk dives deep into how Web Fragments work at scale. If you have ever wondered how to manage micro-frontends without everything falling apart, this one is for you.

We cover the real challenges teams face when trying to modernize their frontends and how Web Fragments solve problems that other approaches just cannot handle.

## Micro-frontends Done Right?

This is a big one! In this session, we go all in on the question everyone is asking: are micro-frontends actually a good idea? Spoiler alert... yes, but only if you do them right.

We break down the common pitfalls, why so many teams struggle with micro-frontend architectures, and how Web Fragments flip the script by enabling truly independent deployments without the usual fate-sharing headaches.

## A Conversation with RedMonk

We also had a great chat with the folks at RedMonk about where frontend architecture is headed and how Web Fragments fit into the bigger picture.

This one is more of a casual conversation, so if you want to hear us talk shop about the future of web development, grab a coffee and hit play.
