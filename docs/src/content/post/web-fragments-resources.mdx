Hey folks! 👋

If you have been curious about Web Fragments and want to learn more about what we are building, you are in the right place. We have been out there talking about micro-frontends, sharing our vision, and geeking out about frontend architecture. And lucky for you, (and for us!) it was all recorded!

Here are some videos that will get you up to speed on Web Fragments and why we think this is a game changer for frontend teams everywhere.

## Señors at Scale

We joined Dan Neciu to discuss how Web Fragments work at scale! This has to be the most comprehensive explanation about Web Fragments, we delivered so far.

If you have ever wondered how to manage micro-frontends without everything falling apart, this one is for you. 


<YouTube id="JY2Yjy2020I" />

We cover the real challenges teams face when trying to modernize their frontends and how Web Fragments solve problems that other approaches just cannot handle. There is also a bit of JavaScript Drama™ to enjoy!

## Micro-frontends Done Right?

This is a big one! In this session Ryan Carniato and Linsley Tanner hosted us  to go all in on the question everyone is asking: are micro-frontends actually a good idea? Spoiler alert... yes, but only if you do them right.

We break down the common pitfalls, why so many teams struggle with micro-frontend architectures, and how Web Fragments flip the script by enabling truly independent deployments without the usual fate-sharing headaches. Nerd alert: We dive deep!

## A Conversation with RedMonk

We also had a great chat with our friend Kate Holterhoff, Senior Analyst at RedMonk about where frontend architecture is headed and how Web Fragments fit into the bigger picture.

This one is more of a casual conversation, so if you want to hear us talk shop about the future of web development, grab a coffee and hit play.
