Web Fragments uses `custom elements` as an implementation detail to embed applications in an existing user-interface. By using custom elements keep the implementation lightweight and benefit from using `shadowRoot` for style encapsulation.

Additionally, all scripts of the fragment application execute in an isolated JavaScript context.

## Custom elements registration

Before using the Web Fragments on the client-side of an application, the library needs to be initialized via exported `initializeWebFragments()` function:

```javascript
import { initializeWebFragments } from "web-fragments";

initializeWebFragments();
```

This initialization should occur as early as possible during the bootstrap of a the existing application.

Please notice that different frameworks may require additional utilities to work with `custom elements`. For example `Angular` needs `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` to be provided.

## The `<web-fragment>` element

`<web-fragment>` is a custom element responsible for marking the location in the existing application where a Web Fragment should be nested.

`<web-fragment>` have a `fragment-id` attribute to uniquely identify the fragment.

```html
<web-fragment fragment-id="some-id"></web-fragment>
```

By default, `<web-fragment>` will create a bound fragment, which shares (binds) `window.location` and navigation history with the existing application that contains the fragment.
The `window.location` in a bound fragment is initialized to the current `window.location` of the top level application.
Navigation initialized from the existing application or a web fragment will be reflected in both contexts.

Optionally, a fragment can be created with the `src` attribute, which specifies the url from which the fragment should be initialized.
This will cause a creation of an "unbound" fragments, which has its own `window.location` and history, both of which are independent of that of the rest of the application or other fragments.

Both bound and unbound fragments run in a dedicated JavaScript context through [reframing](./reframing.md) â€” a virtualization technique unique to Web Fragments.

## Server-side piercing

Server-side piercing refers to he process through which the legacy app shell is combined with the server-side rendered HTML stream of a fragment.

It allows the eager display and initialization of a fragment at the moment of bootstrapping the shell application.

[piercing-styles](./glossary#eager-rendering-piercing) configured during fragment registration, help positioning the fragment in the correct slot.

## Routing of fragment's requests

All requests initiated from DOM or JavaScript of a fragment are intercepted by the fragment gateway middleware.
This middleware sits in front of the legacy application, identifies requests originating from the fragment via the `routePattern` in the fragment registration configuration, and reroutes all assets requests to the right fragment endpoint.

Learn more about middleware in the [gateway](./gateway) section.
